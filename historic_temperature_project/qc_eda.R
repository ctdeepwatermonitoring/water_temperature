#Flag threshold values
#Gross value
#F: temp is greater than 30 OR
#   temp is less than -2

#S: temp is greater than 25 AND temp is less than 30 OR
#   temp is less than -0.1 AND temp is greater than -2

#P: temp is less than 25 AND temp is greater than -0.1


#Spike
#F: temp increases or decreases by more than 1.5 degrees C from the last reading

#S: temp increases or decreases by more than 1 degree C from the last reading

#P: temp increases or decreases by less than 1 degree C from the last reading


#Rate of Change
#S: temp changes by more than 3 standard deviations compared to the previous value (SD computed over a 25 hour period)

#P: temp changes by less than 3 standard deviations compared to the previous value (SD computed over a 25 hour period)


#Flat-line
#F: temp remains constant for 30 or more consecutive values

#s: temp remains constant for 15 or more consecutive values but less than 30 consecutive values

#P: temp remains constant for less than 15 values


#Overall
#F: If any other flag fails then the overall flag fails

#S: If any other flag is suspect and no flag fails then the overall flag is suspect

#P: If at least one flag passes and the rest either pass or have no data then the overall flag passes.
